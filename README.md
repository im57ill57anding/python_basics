# DevHouse Django Backend (Exercises for the first Week)

1 - Create a **Computation class** with a default constructor (without parameters) allowing to perform various calculations on integers numbers.

2 - Create a method called **getFactorial()** which allows calculating the factorial of an integer. Test the method by instantiating the class.

3 - Create a method called **getSum()** allowing to calculate the sum of the first n integers **1 + 2 + 3 + .. + n.** Test this method.

4 - Create a method called **checkPrime()** in the Calculation class to test the primality of a given integer. Test this method.

5 - Create a method called **getPrimes()** allowing to test if two numbers are prime between them.

6 - Create a **getMultiplicationTable()** method which creates and displays the multiplication table of a given integer. Then create an **getAllMultiplicationTables()** method to display all the integer multiplication tables 1, 2, 3, ..., 9.

7 - Create a static **getListOfDivisors()** method that gets all the divisors of a given integer on new list called **answer**.

8 - Create another **getListOfistPrimeDivisors()** method that gets all the prime divisors of a given integer.
